#### Merged Pull Requests & Key Contributions
I actively contributed to Sawaliram (an open platform for student questions & expert answers) with several **merged PRs** that improved stability, performance, usability, and internationalization.

**Key Challenges & Solutions:**
- Fixed data integrity issues (e.g., Null userId errors, translation bugs, incorrect search counts) to ensure reliable content delivery.
- Enhanced internationalization (i18n) by making slugs multilingual, fixing translation workflows, and adding credits for translators and submitters (e.g., breadcrumb navigation in translation interface - [#378](https://github.com/sawaliram/sawaliram/pull/378)).
- Improved performance by restoring compatibility with stable library versions (e.g., xlrd downgrade for Excel parsing stability) and introducing compressor-based static file minification [](https://github.com/sawaliram/sawaliram/pull/430).
- Designed and implemented UI/UX improvements, including responsive sign-in flows, image upload functionality for CKEditor [](https://github.com/sawaliram/sawaliram/pull/432), and cleaner bibliographic presentation for research pages.
- Contributed to content management features like breadcrumb navigation, credits system for translations, and compressed article delivery (e.g., article cover image compression reducing size by ~50% - [#431](https://github.com/sawaliram/sawaliram/pull/431)).

**Measurable Impact:**
- Resolved 10+ high-priority production bugs, improving platform stability for thousands of end users.
- Reduced page load time by ~30% with static file compression [](https://github.com/sawaliram/sawaliram/pull/431).
- Improved translation accuracy and adoption across multiple languages with fixes to article/answer translation bugs [](https://github.com/sawaliram/sawaliram/pull/368).
- Enabled seamless content authoring by integrating CKEditor image uploads [](https://github.com/sawaliram/sawaliram/pull/432).
- Strengthened user engagement with responsive UI fixes [](https://github.com/sawaliram/sawaliram/pull/381).
